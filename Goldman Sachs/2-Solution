//Solution -

int doOverlap(int L1[], int R1[], int L2[], int R2[]) {
  if(L1[0]>R2[0] || L2[0]>R1[0]) // check if any rectangle is on left of other 
    return false; 
  if(L1[1]<R2[1] || L2[1]<R1[1]) //check if any rectangle is above of other
    return false;
  return true;
}

/*
Time Complexity - O(1)
Space Complexity - O(1)

Algorithm  (Assuming rectangles are overlapping even when they just touch and also assuming rectangles are never line) - 
1- Check if a rectangle is on left side of other.
2- Check if a rectangle is above the other rectangle.
3- If none of the above condition is true, then rectangles overlap.
